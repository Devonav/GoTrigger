# Electron Build Fix - better-sqlite3 Compatibility

## Issue
`better-sqlite3@9.6.0` was incompatible with Electron 38, which requires C++20. The rebuild failed with errors about missing C++20 features.

## Root Cause
- Electron 38.2.0 requires C++20 support
- better-sqlite3 v9.x was built for older C++ standards
- The native module couldn't compile against Electron 38's headers

## Solution
Upgraded better-sqlite3 to version 11.9.0 which has full Electron 38 support.

## Changes Made

### 1. Upgraded better-sqlite3
```bash
npm install better-sqlite3@11.9.0
```

### 2. Updated package.json
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "better-sqlite3": "^11.9.0"  // Was: "^9.6.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. Successful Rebuild
```bash
npm run rebuild
# ✔ Rebuild Complete
```

## Verification

### Build Success
```bash
npm run electron:build
# ✓ Compiled successfully
```

### Output Files
```
dist/electron/
├── biometric-handler.js
├── database-handler.js
├── main.js
├── preload.js
├── sqlite-database.js
└── triple-layer-handlers.js
```

## Next Steps

### Run the Desktop App
```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

This will:
1. Start Angular dev server (http://localhost:4200)
2. Build Electron main process
3. Launch Electron app with hot reload

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build              # Build Angular app
npm run electron:build     # Build Electron
npm run package:mac        # Create macOS .dmg
```

## Compatibility Matrix

| Package | Version | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Electron | 38.2.0 | Requires C++20 |
| better-sqlite3 | 11.9.0 | ✅ Electron 38 compatible |
| Node.js | 22.14.0 | ✅ Compatible |
| @electron/rebuild | 4.0.1 | ✅ Working |

## Troubleshooting

### If rebuild fails in the future:
```bash
# Clean rebuild
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run rebuild
```
